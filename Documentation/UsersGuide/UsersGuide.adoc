The Dataphor User's Guide introduces the Dataphor product, and provides information on using the
Dataphor product. The Guide provides an overview of the motivation behind Dataphor, introduces
the Dataphor platform and the anatomy of a Dataphor application, then provides several tutorials.
In addition, the guide provides a section on using applications built with Dataphor, and discusses
administration of a Dataphor Server.

Application development in the software industry is a complex and multi-faceted problem.
Software architects and engineers are faced with a multitude of issues ranging from performance
and scalability to security and usability. Over the years, more and more of these issues have been
resolved generally by implementing the solutions in server layer software.
With each layer of
automation, application development becomes more and more declarative, and less and less
procedural.
In other words, the developer simply states what is to be done, not how it should be
accomplished.

Dataphor represents a next step in that evolution from procedural to declarative development.
The product is designed from the ground up to be a declarative development environment.
This part of the Dataphor User's Guide provides an introduction to the Dataphor application development
platform and the technologies it contains. It introduces each component of the product, and provides detailed information on using the product to develop, deploy, and maintain Dataphor
applications.
This part is organized as follows:

[horizontal]
link:ProductTour.adoc[Product Tour]:: Provides an overview of the entire Dataphor platform, and describes the concrete elements of
the architecture.
link:Dataphoria.adoc[Dataphoria]:: Covers Dataphoria, the Dataphor development environment.
link:DataphorService.adoc[Dataphor Service]:: Discusses installation and administration of the Dataphor Service.
link:Security.adoc[Security]:: Discusses the Dataphor Security Model from the Administrator's perspective.
link:UsingDataphorApplications.adoc[Using Dataphor Applications]:: Contains an in-depth discussion on using Dataphor applications from the perspective of an
end-user.

The first four chapters are intended to be read by Dataphor developers and administrators, while the
final chapter is intended to be read by anyone using a Dataphor application.

****
The Dataphor Platform is largely based on the concepts portrayed in *The Third Manifesto:
Foundation for Future Database Systems* [3] by C. J. Date and Hugh Darwen. The book is the
culmination of thirty years of research and development in the relational model, and brings together
in one volume the current state of the art in relational theory. For a complete list of the references
used in building the Dataphor Server, refer to the Notices and References section of this manual.
Alphora gratefully acknowledges all those who have contributed time and energy to the computer
science field in general, and the relational field in particular.
