== Summary

The Dataphor Developer's Guide discusses the declarative approach to
application development as a solution to many of the technical problems
associated with producing software. It is primarily intended to be read
by software engineers; however, much of the material is
pertinent for application and database administrators as well,
particularly the discussions in Part I.

Part I is a general introduction to the motivation and foundation of the
Dataphor product. It discusses the declarative approach to application
development, and provides an architectural overview of the Dataphor
product.

Part II discusses logical application design using the declarative
approach. It describes in detail the conceptual level of the Dataphor
product, including the D4 language, and how it can best be utilized to
achieve the benefits of the declarative approach.

Part III discusses the presentation layer of the Dataphor product,
including facilities for traditional Rapid Application Development (RAD)
as well as describing the Automated Application Development (AAD)
paradigm.

Part IV discusses the physical realization of a Dataphor application. It
provides in-depth discussion of the Storage Integration Architecture
(SIA) which provides the mapping between the logical description of the
application and the physical implementation of that application.

Part V is the D4 Language Guide, which provides a complete description
of the syntax and semantics of the D4 language.

|Description |Example
|Regular text |D4 provides a powerful set of data manipulation
capabilities, as well as a rich type system for describing even the most
complex data.

|Code block with *bold* denoting keywords a|
....
create table Employee { ID : Integer, Name : String, key { ID } };
....

|inline code with *bold* denoting keywords |Any given value has a type
associated with it, for example, *table* \{ *row* \{ 5 ID } } is a table
value with type *table* \{ ID : System.Integer }.

|Keywords (also used in code blocks) |*select*

|Introduction of new terms. |_physical representation_

|Dataphor Identifiers |`System.Abs` returns the Absolute value
(nonnegative) of a given value.

|Keyboard Keys |F1

|Key Combinations |Ctrl+C

|Buttons in the interfaces |Add...

|Commands or Executable files |`DAEService.exe`
