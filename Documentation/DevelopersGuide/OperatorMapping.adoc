[[DDGOperatorMapping]]
== Summary

Beyond basic data retrieval, many of the devices in the Dataphor product
allow the target systems to be enlisted for use as query processors. The
majority of the optimization tasks performed by the Dataphor query
processor involve deciding where the various parts of a given expression
will be evaluated.

This flexibility allows the behavior of target systems to be modeled not
only for the purpose of providing persistence, but in order to take
advantage of the transactional and performance characteristics of those
systems. The primary mechanism for describing the behavior of a target
system is the __operator map__.

Each device has a set of operator maps that indicate which D4 operators
are supported by the device. Note that only operators which return a
value are mapped. Each operator map is responsible for determining
whether a given expression containing an invocation of that operator is
supported by the device, and how that invocation should be translated in
order to be understood by the target system.

Operator maps can be as simple as the mapping for integer addition, or
as complex as the *join* operator. For the SQL-based devices that ship
with the Dataphor product, the system-defined operators that can be
supported are already mapped. Support for additional operators can be
provided relatively easily. This chapter discusses how operator maps
work, and what is involved in their creation and usage.

There are essentially four different methods for mapping operators into
devices:

* Map the operator using an existing translation handler.
* Map the operator to a function call on the target system.
* Map the operator as an in-lined expression in the target system
dialect.
* Map the operator using a custom host-implemented translation handler.

The first three methods of mapping will be discussed in the following
sections but one. The final method of operator mapping is beyond the
scope of this documentation. For more information on this method of
operator, consult the Dataphor Extender's Development Kit.

[[DDGOperatorMapping-GenericOperatorMaps]]
== Generic Operator Maps

Common SQL support provides operator mapping classes for many of the D4
system operators. In addition to support for specific operators, the SQL
device introduces several general purpose translators that can be used
without modification to handle most operator mappings.

The following table describes these handlers:

[cols=",",options="header",]
|=======================================================================
|Translation Handler |Functionality Provided
|SQLScalarSelector |Provides a basic passthrough implementation, in
other words, the operator mapped to this handler is skipped in the
translation output. This is useful when the device representation for a
particular data type is known to be the same as the device
representation for the data type of the single scalar component of the
representation for a given selector. For example, the type ID \{
*representation* ID \{ Value : String } } would have the same device
representation as String, and so a selector invocation ID("001") would
effectively be translated to just the string literal "001".

|SQLScalarReadAccessor |Provides a basic passthrough implementation for
read accessors. To continue with the above example, the invocation in D4
ID.Value could be translated by simply ignoring the read accessor.

|SQLScalarWriteAccessor |Provides a basic passthrough implementation for
write accessors. The D4 assignment to ID.Value can be translated to SQL
by a replacement of the value if the representation has a single scalar
component with the same device representation as the type itself.

|SQLScalarIsSpecialOperator |Provides a basic implementation for the
IsSpecial operators created for each domain. If a domain has no
specials, this handler is appropriate, as it always emits 0 = 1 or
false, in SQL.

|SQLCallOperator |Provides a generic handler that is capable of invoking
an operator in SQL. This handler has an attribute called OperatorName,
set through the attributes in the class definition, which is used to
construct the output. For example, if the operator name of the handler
is Rand, and the handler is mapped to the D4 operator Random, the result
of translating the D4 expression Random(5) is Rand(5). The call operator
works with any number of operands for the operator being mapped. This is
useful when the implementation for a specific operator in D4 is provided
by a user-defined function in the target system.

|SQLUserOperator |Provides a generic handler that allows the translated
expression to be written directly. This handler has an attribute called
TranslationString, set through the attributes in the class definition,
or directly with the Storage.TranslationString tag of the operator map.
The provided translation string may contain format markers to indicate
where the translated expression for each argument is to be embedded. For
example, given the translation string \{0} + \{1}, the D4 expression 1 +
2 would be translated directly as 1 + 2.

[[DDGOperatorMapping-MappingOperatorswithExistingHandlers]]
== Mapping Operators with Existing Handlers

The SQL devices provide a large number of existing translation handlers
to map the system-provided operators. In many cases, these mappings can
be used as-is to map certain common operators. For example, in the
Shipping application, the mapping for
iMultiplication(ShippingRate,Â Distance) is provided by the following
mapping:

....
alter device Shipping
{
    create operator iMultiplication(Distance, ShippingRate)
        class "SQLDevice.SQLMultiplication"
};
....

The advantage of using a dedicated translation handler such as this one
is that the mapping is device-independent, at least among the SQL
devices. Each device would be able to make use of this mapping, with any
syntactic differences in the actual invocation of the operator being
handled by the emitter of the specific device.

[[DDGOperatorMapping-MappingOperatorsasFunctions]]
== Mapping Operators as Functions

To avoid having to create a host-implemented translation handler for
each operator to be mapped, the SQL devices allow for a generic
"call"-style mapping, which simply invokes the operator as a function
call on the target system. The name of the function to be invoked is
specified as part of the definition of the operator mapping. For
example, the Distance operator is mapped using the following statement:

....
alter device Shipping
{
    create operator Distance(Coordinate, Coordinate)
        class "SQLDevice.SQLCallOperator"
            attributes { "OperatorName" = "dbo.Shipping_Distance" }
}
....

[[DDGOperatorMapping-MappingOperatorsasExpressions]]
== Mapping Operators as Expressions

If creating functions in the target system is not an option, either for
security reasons, or because the target system does not support
functions, the operator mapping may be specified using an in-line
expression. This method is accomplished specifying the
Storage.TranslationString tag on the operator mapping:

....
alter device Shipping
{
    create operator iMultiplication(Distance, ShippingRate)
        tags { Storage.TranslationString = "{0} * {1}" }
};
....

This mapping specifies that the operator is mapped by inlining the given
translation string, and replacing the parameter markers (\{0}) with the
translated expression representing the argument specified by the index
of the parameter marker.

This method of mapping will work for most operators, but it will not
work if the operator cannot be expressed in terms of a single
expression. For example, the definition of the Factorial function
requires the use of a *while* loop, and so cannot be expressed within a
single expression. In these cases, a function mapping must be used.

[[DDGOperatorMapping-MappingSelectorsandAccessors]]
== Mapping Selectors and Accessors

Selectors and accessors form a large part of the mappings required to
support any given scalar type. Not only must the type map be provided in
order to translate values to and from the device, but the accessors and
selectors that appear within expressions referencing values of the type
in D4 must be translated so that the expressions can be mapped into the
target system.

For most *like* types, this process is relatively straightforward, and
the Dataphor Server will usually provide the mappings automatically. For
relatively more complex types like the Degree or Coordinate types in the
Shipping application, these mappings must be provided explicitly.

To illustrate the process, we will consider the mapping of the Degree
type, and all of its selectors and accessors. For reference, the
following listing provides the complete definition of the degree type:

....
create type Degree
{
    representation Degrees { Degrees : Decimal },
    representation Degree
    {
        DegreesPart : Integer
            read GetDegreesPart(value.Degrees)
            write Degrees(SetDegreesPart(value.Degrees, DegreesPart)),
        MinutesPart : Integer
            read GetMinutesPart(value.Degrees)
            write Degrees(SetMinutesPart(value.Degrees, MinutesPart)),
        SecondsPart : Decimal
            read GetSecondsPart(value.Degrees)
            write Degrees(SetSecondsPart(value.Degrees, SecondsPart))
    } selector Degrees(GetDegrees(DegreesPart, MinutesPart, SecondsPart)),
    representation AsString
    {
        AsString : String
            read DegreesToString(value.Degrees)
            write Degrees(StringToDegrees(AsString))
    } selector Degrees(StringToDegrees(AsString))
};
....

Note that the definitions of the various operators used by the selectors
and accessors have been omitted here, but in order to support queries
that involve these operators, operator maps will have to be provided for
each one.

Because the native representation of the type is Decimal, the type
mapping itself is relatively straightforward, and is automatically
provided by the Dataphor Server. For illustration, we list the generated
mappings here:

....
alter device Shipping
{
    create type Degree class "SQLDevice.SQLDecimal",
    create operator Degrees(Decimal) class "SQLDevice.SQLScalarSelector",
    create operator Degrees.ReadDegrees(Degree) class "SQLDevice.SQLScalarReadAccessor",
    create operator Degrees.WriteDegrees(Degree, Decimal) class "SQLDevice.SQLScalarWriteAccessor",
    create operator iCompare(Degree, Degree) class "SQLDevice.SQLCompare",
    create operator IsSpecial(Degree) class "SQLDevice.SQLScalarIsSpecialOperator"
};
....

By default, each of these mappings will be provided by the Dataphor
Server based on the native representation of Decimal, and the existing
Decimal mappings for the device.

However, the Degree representation is significantly more complex, and
the mappings for this representation cannot be provided automatically.
Briefly, the following listing shows the operators that must be mapped
for this representation:

....
operator Degree(Integer, Integer, Decimal);
operator ReadDegreesPart(Degree);
operator WriteDegreesPart(Degree, Integer);
operator ReadMinutesPart(Degree);
operator WriteMinutesPart(Degree, Integer);
operator ReadSecondsPart(Degree);
operator WriteSecondsPart(Degree, Decimal);
....

In the Shipping application, each of these operator is mapped into the
target system by creating a function on the target system, and using the
SQLCallOperator translation handler to specify the mapping. For example,
the following program listing shows the definition of the function used
to handle the Degree selector:

....
create function Shipping_Degree
(
    @Degrees int,
    @Minutes int,
    @Seconds decimal(28, 8)
) returns decimal(28, 8)
begin
    return @Degrees + (@Minutes / 60.0) + (@Seconds / 3600.0)
end
....

This statement creates a function called Shipping_Degree in the target
system. The following operator mapping then instructs the device that
the Degree selector is mapped by invoking this function:

....
alter device Shipping
{
    create operator Degree(Integer, Integer, Decimal)
        class "SQLDevice.SQLCallOperator"
            attributes { "OperatorName" = "dbo.Shipping_Degree" }
};
....

Alternatively, if functions cannot be created on the target system, the
following mapping may be used for the Degree selector:

....
alter device Shipping
{
    create operator Degree(Integer, Integer, Decimal)
        tags { Storage.TranslationString = "{0} + ({1} / 60.0) + ({2} / 3600.0)" }
};
....

This mapping instructs the device that the Degree selector is mapped by
directly inlining the expression given in the translation string,
replacing the parameter markers (\{0}) with the translation for the
expression specified by the index of the parameter marker. Note that the
translation string is written directly in the dialect of the target
system, so this method of operator mapping is not immune to dialectic
differences among target systems.
